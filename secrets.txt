Whatever is profound loves masks; what is most profound even hates image and parable. 
Might not nothing less than the opposite , be the proper disguise for the shame of a god? 
A questionable question: it would be odd if some mystic had not risked something to that effect in his mind. 
There are occurrences of such a delicate nature that one does well to cover them up with some rudeness to conceal them; 
there are actions of love and extravagant generosity after which nothing is more advisable than to take a stick 
and give any eyewitness a sound thrashing: that would muddle his memory. 
Some know how to muddle and abuse their own memory in order to have their revenge at least against this only witness: 
shame is inventive.
